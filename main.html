    For my final project I decided to focus my attention and bring light on the growing suicide rates within men and the toxic masculinity that most men face within their lives. We all know the toxic cultire of a man, the one where the man is always seen as an aggressor, always grumpy, a tough person, emotionless, and unaffectionate. As boys we are taught not to cry, we are told that it will make us look weak and that men do not cry. We are told as men we must be the ones to provide and protect and if we are unfit to we are of no use. These expectations of us as men is something that can negatively effect someone, because what if they cannot, and that voice in their head telling them they are not a man, they are weak, they cannot provide. It becomes like a broken record repeating itself over and over again. Imagine that and then not being able to properly adhere to your emotions and express yourself properly, it begins to just eat you on the inside. We need to change the way we raise our boys teaching them to cry, be themselves, and to express themselves. These things are happening in all walks of life, in all countries amongst various different cultures.
